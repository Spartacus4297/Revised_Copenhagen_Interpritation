Project overview:
------------------------------------------------------------
The purpose of this script is to provide preliminary validation of the hypothesis that;
Environmental Energy Density in the form of Rho_E has a significant impact on the rate of quantum decoherence.

As you will see in this version of the script Rho_E is not yet fully defined instead the value Rho_E (x) is calculated.
This is a necessity as Rho_E (x) is fundamental to the calculation of Lambda for relativistic equations such as Einstein's field equations.

The script aims to explore how variations in environmental energy density impact the rate of quantum decoherence
and contribute the long-sought reconciliation of Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity.

Core Concepts:
------------------------------------------------------------
you're probably now wondering: How does environmental energy density effect quantum decoherence?

The concept is quite simple really, what happens when you have a large quanity of a gas in a fixed volume? you experience the emergent force of pressure,
this applies across scales regardless of any apparent disconnects as energy can neither be created nor destroyed.
In higher energy density regions such as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) at time of its emission, Galaxies, Galactic superclusters
and other large scale structures of the universe, this increased energy density the leads to higher rates of quantum decoherence.

Conversly in lower energy density regions of space, such as cosmic voids like the Bo√∂tes void experience a lower rate of decoherence.
This difference implies that energy density plays a critical role in the decoherence process,
ultimately impacting the tranistion from quantum to classical states;
potentially providing insights into the reconciliation of Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity.
